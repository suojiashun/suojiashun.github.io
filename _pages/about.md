<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Beihang University (2023–2027), advised by Professor Limin Xiao and Professor Xiaojian Liao. 
I received my M.S. degree from Yunnan University in 2022, advised by Professor Weisong Shi (Adjunct Professor at Yunnan University) and Professor Wei Zhou, and my B.S. degree from Hubei Polytechnic University in 2019.

My research interests include **ML systems** and **edge computing**, focusing on performance optimization for AI inference systems and edge AI applications. 
I have published several conference and journal papers in venues such as ASPLOS, IEEE IoT-J, Scientific Data (Nature), and UIC.
