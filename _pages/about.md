<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Beihang University (2023 – present), under the supervision of Professor [Limin Xiao](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/2653.htm) and [Xiaojian Liao](https://liaoxiaojian.github.io/). 
I received my M.Eng. degree from Yunnan University in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Weisong Shi](https://weisongshi.org/) and [Wei Zhou](http://www.sei.ynu.edu.cn/info/1023/1106.htm). 
I obtained my B.Eng. degree from Hubei Polytechnic University in 2019.

My research interests include **AI/ML Systems** and **Edge Computing**, focusing on performance optimization for AI inference systems and edge AI applications. 
I have published several conference and journal papers in venues such as **ASPLOS**, **IEEE IoT-J**, and **Scientific Data (Nature)**.
